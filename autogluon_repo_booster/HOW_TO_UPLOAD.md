# How to Upload These Files to Your Existing GitHub Repo (Web UI)

1) Open your repo: https://github.com/anuradha1105/Autogluon
2) Click **Add file ▸ Upload files**.
3) Drag-and-drop the following files/folders from this booster pack:
   - `README.md` (if you already have one, you can replace it)
   - `.gitignore`
   - `artifacts/.gitkeep` (create the folder structure if it doesn't exist)
   - `data/.gitkeep`
   - `SUBMISSION_COMMENT.txt`
   - `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`
4) Click **Commit changes**.

## Add the notebooks
1) Extract the notebooks from the other ZIP I provided (`autogluon_data_mining_starters.zip`).
2) In GitHub: **Add file ▸ Upload files** again.
3) Place all `.ipynb` under `colabs/` folder in the repo (create the folder if missing).
4) Commit.

## Verify
- You should now see `colabs/`, `artifacts/`, `data/` in the root.
- Open a notebook in GitHub, then click **Open in Colab** to run.
