        "**Tip**: If you are new to AutoGluon, review [Predicting Columns in a Table - Quick Start](tabular-quick-start.ipynb) to learn the basics of the AutoGluon API. To learn how to add your own custom models to the set that AutoGluon trains, tunes, and ensembles, review [Adding a custom model to AutoGluon](advanced/tabular-custom-model.ipynb).\n",

        "This tutorial describes how you can exert greater control when using AutoGluon's `fit()` or `predict()`. Recall that to maximize predictive performance, you should first try `TabularPredictor()` and `fit()` with all default arguments.  Then, consider non-default arguments for `TabularPredictor(eval_metric=...)`, and `fit(presets=...)`.  Later, you can experiment with other arguments to fit() covered in this in-depth tutorial like `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`, `hyperparameters`, `num_stack_levels`, `num_bag_folds`, `num_bag_sets`, etc.\n",

        "Using the same census data table as in the [Predicting Columns in a Table - Quick Start](tabular-quick-start.ipynb) tutorial, we'll now predict the `occupation` of an individual - a multiclass classification problem. Start by importing AutoGluon's TabularPredictor and TabularDataset, and loading the data."

        "\n",
        "**Note: We don't recommend doing hyperparameter-tuning with AutoGluon in most cases**. AutoGluon achieves its best performance without hyperparameter tuning and simply specifying `presets=\"best_quality\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We first demonstrate hyperparameter-tuning and how you can provide your own validation dataset that AutoGluon internally relies on to: tune hyperparameters, early-stop iterative training, and construct model ensembles. One reason you may specify validation data is when future test data will stem from a different distribution than training data (and your specified validation data is more representative of the future data that will likely be encountered).\n",
        "\n",
        " If you don't have a strong reason to provide your own validation dataset, we recommend you omit the `tuning_data` argument. This lets AutoGluon automatically select validation data from your provided training set (it uses smart strategies such as stratified sampling).  For greater control, you can specify the `holdout_frac` argument to tell AutoGluon what fraction of the provided training data to hold out for validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Caution:** Since AutoGluon tunes internal knobs based on this validation data, performance estimates reported on this data may be over-optimistic. For unbiased performance estimates, you should always call `predict()` on a separate dataset (that was never passed to `fit()`), as we did in the previous **Quick-Start** tutorial. We also emphasize that most options specified in this tutorial are chosen to minimize runtime for the purposes of demonstration and you should select more reasonable values in order to obtain high-quality models.\n",
        "\n",
        "`fit()` trains neural networks and various types of tree ensembles by default. You can specify various hyperparameter values for each type of model. For each hyperparameter, you can either specify a single fixed value, or a search space of values to consider during hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameters which you do not specify are left at default settings chosen automatically by AutoGluon, which may be fixed values or search spaces.\n",
