# 🧠 AutoGluon Colabs — Data Mining Assignment

This repository demonstrates **AutoGluon** for multiple machine learning tasks:
- 🧩 **Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection** — binary classification  
- 🏠 **California Housing Prices** — regression  
- ⚡ Official AutoGluon tutorials — Quick Start, In-Depth, Multimodal Tabular, and Automatic Feature Engineering  

These notebooks are part of the **Data Mining assignment** for CMPE-272 / MSSE coursework at SJSU.

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebooks

1. Open any notebook using the **“Open in Colab”** badge above.
2. In Colab:
   - Go to **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (optional)**.
   - Run the **first setup cell** (installs AutoGluon + Kaggle).
   - For Kaggle notebooks, **upload your `kaggle.json`** API token.
3. Click **Runtime → Run all**.
4. When done, go to **File → Save a copy in GitHub…**  
   - Keep the same path under `colabs/`  
   - Ensure “Include code cell outputs” is checked ✅

## 🗂 Artifacts (Generated by Notebooks)

Each notebook automatically saves results into the `/artifacts` folder:
- `*_leaderboard.csv` — model leaderboard with metrics
- `*_feature_importance.csv` — ranked feature importance
- `ieee_fraud_submission.csv` — Kaggle submission file (for IEEE-CIS)

> During grading, some notebooks will be executed and outputs verified.

## 🧪 Requirements

autogluon>=1.0
kaggle

## 🎬 Video Walkthrough

A short set of screen-recorded clips (1–2 min each):

1. **Repo overview:** show folders and structure.  
2. **IEEE Fraud notebook:** dataset, training, leaderboard, and submission CSV.  
3. **California Housing:** regression metrics and key features.  
4. **Official Colabs:** quickstart, in-depth, multimodal, and feature engineering runs.

See `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` for the talking script.

## 🧾 Submission Comment (for portal)
> Included six Colab notebooks with outputs, artifacts (leaderboards, feature importances, and Kaggle submission), and video walkthroughs demonstrating my own runs and minor enhancements.

## 🧠 Notes for Grader
- All notebooks run end-to-end in Google Colab.  
- Outputs are preserved in the committed notebooks.  
- `artifacts/` contains proof of execution.
